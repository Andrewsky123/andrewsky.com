## Course Outline

Topics covered include:  Principles of Bayesian statistics; one- and two-sample Bayesian models; Bayesian linear and generalized linear models; Monte Carlo approaches to model fitting; Prior elicitation; Hypothesis testing and model selection; Complex error structures, hierarchical models; Statistical packages such as BUGS/WinBUGS, R, and RStan. 

## Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of the course, successful students will:
* Understand the philosophy of Bayesian statistical modeling. 
* Understand Bayesian models for numerous common data analysis situations, including prior elicitation. 
* Be able to use software such as R, WinBUGS, and RStan to implement Bayesian analyses. 
* Understand basic principles of both conjugate analyses and MCMC-based Bayesian analyses.
