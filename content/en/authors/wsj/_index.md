I am the director of the Institute of Statistics in College of Economics at [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/). My research interests are mainly in Bayesian Statistical Modeling, Quantitative Financeï¼Œand Structural Equation Modeling. I have rich practical experience in guiding government departments and enterprises to carry out surveys on statistical data analysis, and various economic and social issues. I have presided over three projects at the provincial and ministerial level or above, and hosted or participated in more than a dozen other vertical and horizontal research projects.
