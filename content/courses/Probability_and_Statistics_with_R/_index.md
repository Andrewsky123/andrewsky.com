By training the students' English reading ability and presentation skills, students will be able to read and understand statistical materials, and be able to use the R softeware to manipulate statistical modeling also.

The course will use English textbooks with an emphasis on real applications. Since the R software plays an increasingly important role in recent statistical researches, this course will apply R to statistical analysis. The course is divided into three parts. The first part introduces how to use R software to the basic statistical analysis, including R introduction, data manipulation, statistical graphics and basic statistical analysis. The second part introduces random variables and distributions. The third part introduces statistical modeling, including regression model, analysis of variance, and generalized linear model.
